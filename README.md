This project is a Job Board System built with Django, HTML, and CSS, where two types of users exist: Employers and Employees. Employers can register and log in, and once inside, they get a dashboard where they can post new jobs (with fields like title, description, requirements, salary, and deadline) and view all jobs they have created. Each job also has a dedicated "View Applicants" page, where the employer can see all employees who have applied, along with their cover letters, application timestamps, and uploaded CVs in PDF format. On the other side, employees can register, log in, and access their dashboard, where they can browse all available jobs posted by employers and apply to them by submitting a cover letter and optionally uploading their CV. When an employee applies, their details are stored in the database and become visible to the employer under the respective jobâ€™s applicant list. A home page connects both roles with links to their respective dashboards, and proper authentication ensures that only logged-in users with the correct role can access the corresponding features. In short, the project is a mini job portal that simulates how real hiring platforms work, with role-based dashboards, job postings, and an application system.
